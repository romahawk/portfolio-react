## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `index.html` — add `<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.mazuryk.dev/" />` so search engines consolidate authority on the custom domain
- `Hero.jsx` — replace external LinkedIn ghost CTA with on-site `#contact` anchor ("Get in touch"); keeps conversion loop on-site
- `public/robots.txt`, `public/sitemap.xml`, `index.html` (og:url, og:image, twitter:image) — update all canonical URLs from `roman-mazuryk.vercel.app` to `www.mazuryk.dev`
- `vercel.json` — explicit build config + security headers (`X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`); immutable cache headers for `/assets/`
- `.github/workflows/lighthouse.yml` — Lighthouse CI on every push/PR to `main`; fails build if any category drops below 90
- `.lighthouserc.json` — Lighthouse CI thresholds: Performance ≥ 90, Accessibility ≥ 90, Best Practices ≥ 90, SEO ≥ 90
- "Last updated: Feb 2026" footer added to all 6 case study modals (AlphaRhythm, FlowLogix, LiveSurgery, Medintegro, Portfolio, SmartShooter)

### Fixed
- `Footer.jsx` — replace `icon: Icon` destructuring alias (invisible to ESLint `no-unused-vars`) with direct `icon` + `React.createElement(icon, ...)` pattern
- `Contact.jsx` — add `/* clipboard unavailable */` comment to empty `catch {}` block to satisfy `no-empty` rule
- `AlphorythmCaseStudy.jsx`, `FlowLogixCaseStudy.jsx` — replace literal `->` arrows in JSX text with Unicode `→` to fix parser error

### Performance
- Replace all `import * as Lucide` wildcard imports with named imports + static lookup maps in `Projects.jsx`, `Milestones.jsx`, `JourneyFull.jsx` — enables tree-shaking, removes ~800 kB of unused icon code from bundle
- Lazy-load all 6 case study components with `React.lazy` + `Suspense` — they are modal-only and never needed on initial page load
- Add `manualChunks` to `vite.config.js` to split `react-vendor` into a separate cacheable chunk
- Add `<link rel="preload">` for `/images/profile.jpg` with `fetchpriority="high"` — fixes LCP delay
- Result: initial JS bundle (gzip) reduced from **242 kB → 78 kB** (68% reduction); Lighthouse Performance **38 → 99**

### Added
- Vercel Analytics (`@vercel/analytics`) — privacy-respecting visitor tracking via `<Analytics />` in `App.jsx`
- `docs/PRD.md` — product requirements, target user, MVP scope, acceptance criteria, risks
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — system design, component map, data flow, key trade-offs, scaling notes
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — 12-week outcome-based roadmap with weekly DoD and demo artifacts
- `docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md` — 6 architectural decision records (ADRs) covering routing, CSS, state, data, OS adoption, and build tooling
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file; tracks all shipped changes going forward
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — branch naming conventions, commit rules, PR discipline, release process
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.md` — feature request template with acceptance criteria
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.md` — bug report template with severity and reproduction steps
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` — PR checklist with lint/build/mobile/docs/changelog gates
- `README.md` — rewritten with 30-second pitch, setup steps, project structure, stack table, docs index
